**Short Summary:**  
Four branch offices connected using static routing end-to-end; IP addressing and subnetting; validation with `show ip route` and `ping` tests. Configured multi-site static routing and default gateways; achieved 100% connectivity verified through ICMP tests and routing tables. Documented topology, subnet masks, gateways, and identified/corrected failure points.

# Security

### Virtualized Linux Network – Web Server, SSH, Firewall & Netplan
**Module:** Linux Networking / Cloud & Infrastructure  
**Grade:** 75 / 100  

**Summary:**  
Simulated a Linux-based client–server network using VirtualBox with two Ubuntu VMs. Configured Apache web server, SSH access, static IPs with Netplan, hostnames, UFW firewall rules, and basic network monitoring. Optional tasks included Samba file sharing and DHCP setup.  

**Key Highlights:**  
- Deployed 2 Ubuntu Server VMs with Host-Only + NAT adapters  
- Configured Apache2 web server and tested access via browser & Lynx  
- Set static IPs with Netplan, managed hostnames, and implemented UFW rules  
- Captured network traffic with Wireshark (ICMP, TCP handshake, SSH)  
- Optional: Samba file sharing and DHCP server configuration
